# 🧊 SSG (Static Site Generation) — Detailed Frontend Flow

## ✅ Definition:
Think of SSG as a pre-cooked buffet: All the pages are built ahead of time (at build time), so the server doesn’t cook anything on request. Pages are served instantly like files from a fridge 🍱.

##  Step-by-Step Flow (From URL to Loaded Page)

### 1. Developer builds the project
* During the next build phase in Next.js (or similar in other frameworks), pages using getStaticProps() are pre-rendered once and saved as static HTML files.
```
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/blogs');
  const blogs = await res.json();
  return { props: { blogs } };
}
```

### 2. Static HTML files are generated
* For each route (e.g. /about, /blog/post-1), a corresponding HTML file is created.
* These files are stored on the CDN or file server.

```
/out/index.html
/out/about.html
/out/blog/post-1.html
```

### 3. User types a URL in the browser
* Example: https://myblog.com/about
* Browser sends request to the server/CDN.

### 4. Server/CDN returns static HTML instantly
* Since the HTML is already built, server doesn’t compute anything.
* Response is super fast and scalable.

### 5. Browser renders the HTML immediately
* Page is visible almost instantly because there’s no API call or server rendering at request time.

### 6.  JS bundle loads & hydrates the page
* React's JS bundle is loaded and hydrates the static HTML to make it interactive (like buttons, forms, etc.)
```
ReactDOM.hydrateRoot(document.getElementById('__next'), <App />);
```

## ❌ Cons of SSG
| ❌ Drawback                           | 💬 Explanation                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 💤 Stale Data                        | Data is fixed at build time; changes need rebuild             |
| 🧩 Not Ideal for User-specific Pages | Cannot personalize per request                                |
| ⏱️ Long Build Times                  | Large number of pages = longer build time                     |
| ❌ No Real-Time                       | Can’t reflect API updates until next build (unless using ISR) |


## ⚠️ Drawbacks

| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ SEO                    | Initial HTML has no content, bad for Google/Bing indexing. |
| ⏱️ Slow FCP              | First Contentful Paint is delayed until JS loads and runs. |
| 📶 Poor on slow networks | Heavy JS can cause long blank screens.                     |
