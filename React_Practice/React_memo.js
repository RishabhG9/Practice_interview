/**
 * React.memo
 * 
 * A higher-order component that memoizes a functional component to prevent re-rendering if its props donâ€™t change.
 * 
 * 
 * The Child component will not re-render when you click the button because its prop name is stable ("Alice"), thanks to React.memo.
 * Only Parent will re-render to update the count.
 * 
 * Real use case: components that render with the same props over and over.
